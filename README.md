# Conways-Game-of-Life
A version of Conway's Game of LIfe made in C

To do list for tomorrow: 02-02-2025:
- Try to get more familiar with the SDL2 engine
- The reason why it may not be working is because I'm not implementing SDL2 with it and not drawing with it. Hence, the window would only show black.
- Try to explore font sizes, graphics, etc.
